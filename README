redmine

MODULE NOT YET READY FOR PRODUCTION USE

This is the redmine module.  It provides a configuration pattern for a multiple 
instance redmine service using the debconf modules and Ubuntu patches.  It is 
currently very specific to Ubuntu and it may not even make sense to port it to 
other OSes.
